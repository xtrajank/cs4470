"""Shop price comparison module.

This module helps find the cheapest fruit shop for a given order.

Changes from original (2024 Nov 03):
1. Added comprehensive type hints
2. Used modern string formatting (f-strings)
3. Added detailed docstrings with examples
4. Better module documentation
5. Used Python 3.13 typing features
6. Added proper return type annotations
7. Better code organization
8. Added input validation
9. Used type aliases for clarity
10. Added error handling

Example output:
    Welcome to shop1 fruit shop
    Welcome to shop2 fruit shop
    For orders: [('apples', 1.0), ('oranges', 3.0)] best shop is shop1
    For orders: [('apples', 3.0)] best shop is shop2
