"""Addition module for basic arithmetic operations.

This module provides a simple addition function as part of the UC Berkeley
Pacman AI projects tutorial.

Changes from original (2024 Nov 03):
1. Added comprehensive type hints with overloads
2. Used type variables for better type safety
3. Added detailed docstring with examples
4. Better module documentation
5. Used Python 3.13 typing features
6. Added proper return type annotations
7. Better code organization
8. Added doctest examples
9. More maintainable structure

Run python autograder.py to test.
