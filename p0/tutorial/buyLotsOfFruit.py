"""Fruit purchasing cost calculator.

This module calculates the total cost of a fruit order based on a price list.

Changes from original (2024-03-20):
1. Added comprehensive type hints
2. Used modern string formatting (f-strings)
3. Added detailed docstrings with examples
4. Better module documentation
5. Used Python 3.13 typing features
6. Added proper return type annotations
7. Better code organization
8. Added input validation
9. Used type aliases for clarity
10. Added constants for configuration

To run this script, type:
    python buyLotsOfFruit.py

Example output:
    Cost of [('apples', 2.0), ('pears', 3.0), ('limes', 4.0)] is 12.25
