"""multiAgents.py - Multi-Agent Search Algorithms for Pacman
===========================================================

This module implements various multi-agent search algorithms for the Pacman game,
including reflex agents, minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax search.

The module provides agent classes that:
- Make decisions based on state evaluation functions
- Implement adversarial search algorithms
- Model both deterministic and probabilistic opponent behavior
- Search to configurable depths using evaluation heuristics

Key Classes:
    ReflexAgent: Makes decisions using state evaluation heuristics
    MinimaxAgent: Implements minimax search algorithm
    AlphaBetaAgent: Implements alpha-beta pruning search
    ExpectimaxAgent: Implements expectimax probabilistic search

Usage:
    This module is used by the Pacman game to create AI agents. Agents can be
    selected and configured via command line arguments.

Major Changes:
1. Added type hints throughout the codebase for better code clarity and IDE support
2. Improved docstrings with detailed descriptions and Args/Returns sections
3. Enhanced code organization with better function and variable naming

This code runs on Python 3.13
